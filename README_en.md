# Erlang global store
------
***Note: Because my English is very bad, so this md is based on google translation***

   This is a very simple Erlang global variable sharing app
## Why I do this
   sometimes I need to share some data between all Erlang nodes. I used mnesia at first, but mnesia was too heavy and there were a lot of problems with it. Later, I changed it to [syn plugin](https://github.com/ostinelli/ syn ""), but this plug-in is specifically used for distributed routing, and I need to share more than just routing information. What's more serious is that when a large amount of data floods, syn's broadcast synchronization will bring a very high system load
    Then I also considered using consistent hashing, but the problems I face are more reads and less writes, and the read performance of consistent hashing is obviously not as good as write synchronization.
    So in the end I wrote this synchronous memory dictionary based on a small delay by default.

## features:
   * Key/Value Insert Delete Find
   * Group, which can store a value in a global group
   * Controllable synchronization method:
         * No synchronization, only local modification
         * Delayed synchronization (default), local modifications will be delayed for a period of time before synchronization (to avoid broadcast storms when a large amount of data is flooded, such as when a game server cluster is opened and logged in)
         * Emergency synchronization, leave and synchronize with other nodes
   * When the node is down, other nodes will cancel the data written from this node
## unsupported features:
   * Data conflict resolution, because this is a very simple application, so there is no so-called data conflict resolution, all writes directly overwrite the previous data
   * Data protection, as above, any node can write directly to any key
## how to use
### env variable configuration:
   The following two variables need to be provided in the application env:
        1. Arbiter arbitration server, used to obtain old data when logging in to a new node
        2. sync_delay synchronization delay
    If you are using rebar, add the following settings directly in sys.config
```Erlang
    {gs, [{arbiter, 's1@127.0.0.1'}, {sync_delay, 100}]}
```
### API
#### KV
```Erlang
    -type sync_type() :: local
                   | urgent
                   | delayed.
    gs:insert(Key :: term(), Value :: term()).
    gs:insert(Key :: term(), Value :: term(), sync_type()).
    gs:delete(Key :: term()).
    gs:delete(Key :: term(), sync_type()).
    gs:find(Key :: term()).
```
#### Group
```Erlang
    gs:join_group(GroupName :: term(), Value ::term()).
    gs:join_group(GroupName :: term(), Value ::term(), sync_type()).
    gs:exit_gropp(GroupName :: term(), Value ::term()).
    gs:exit_group(GroupName :: term(), Value ::term(), sync_type()).
    gs:traverse_group(GroupName :: term(), fun((Value :: term()) -> any())).
```
